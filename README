Purpose: The code can be used for subscriptions to be billed automatically. There will be one trail amount and rest of 
         payment is deducted automatically from the buyers of the product on 1st of every month.

Suppose three payments are as follows-
           1) March 15th   -- 50$
           2) April 1st    -- 50$
           3) May 1st      -- 50$

The code should work fine for this scenario.
